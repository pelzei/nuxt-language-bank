        <p class="mt-6">
          The Aesop Language Bank is a collection of samples of languages and
          language varieties, using the classic Greek story about the North Wind
          and the Sun. This story is popular to use among linguists since it is
          short and the concepts in the story are shared by the majority of
          cultures across the earth.<br /><br />
          In the Aesop Languages, you will be able to listen and read the story
          in a number of different languages. The translations and recordings
          have been collected by a number of language enthusiasts and all
          contributors have volunteered to participate, happy to share their
          language.<br /><br />
          As a general rule, the recordings have been made by native speakers. A
          few recordings are in languages or language varieties that have no
          native speakers, and then people with a good command of these
          languages have volunteered. Some language varieties have been recorded
          by people who grew up with these languages and know them equally well
          as a native speaker.
